/*Unit 3, Assignment 1, Question 2
*Zach Robinson
*Date Started : 09/05/19
*For: Ms. Harris and ICS4UI
*Takes in an array of unknown size of various integers and doubles, and sorts them into positive integers, positive doubles, and all negatives.

//It works when testing with a loop of 10 and only entering numbers, but it constantly gave me errors when trying to make it infinite/an unknown size. Also couldn't get anything to work that ensures you can only enter numbers.


//Variables
var aInput = [String]() //The input array is a string so it can hold all the types of input
var arrayPosI = [Int]() //array for positive integers
var arrayPosD = [Double]() //array for positive doubles
var arrayNeg = [String]() //array for negative numbers
var input: String
var xI = 0 //placeholer for integers
var xD = 0.0 //palceholder for doubles
var loop = 1
var nums = 0
var t = 0

print("Please enter a series of integers and/or decimals:") //, enter \"break\" when done:")

//infinte loop so that the user can enter as many numbers as they want
//while loop > 0 {
  for _ in 1...10 {
  input = readLine()!
  if input.lowercased() == "break" { //allows the user to leave the loop
    break
  }
  aInput.append(input)
}

//Seperates the input array into the 3 other arrays
//for num in aInput {
  for num in 1...10 {
  nums = num - 1
  if aInput[nums].contains("-") { //filters for all negatives   split into doubles and integers and then sort and then combine them into one array
    //xI = Int(aInput[y2])! //converts the input array into the integer for the 
    arrayNeg.append(aInput[nums])
  } else if aInput[nums].contains(".") { //filters for positive decimals
    xD = Double(aInput[nums])! //converts the input array into the double for the array
    arrayPosD.append(xD)
  } else { //everything else (would be just integers at this point)
    xI = Int(aInput[nums])! //converts the input array into the integer for the array
    arrayPosI.append(xI) 
  }
}

//Sorting the final arrays
arrayPosI.sort()
arrayPosD.sort()
arrayNeg.sort() //Doesn't really work as it is a String array

print ("\n\nAll the positive integers are: \(arrayPosI)")
print ("All the positive decimals are: \(arrayPosD)")
print ("All the negative numbers are: \(arrayNeg)")
